# PONG

Everybody knows the game Pong. As an exercise I build the game in Unity and gave it a modern spin.

Play against a friend or an AI, choose between the OG experience or a modern spin with powerups. If you are tired by the black and white? Change the background color, just for fun.

# Controls

Player 1 controls the paddle with the arrow keys.
Player 2 with WASD keys.
